        <p><strong>Script (spoken):</strong></p>
        <p>“Right now you’re juggling email, text threads, and your CRM. This Command Center is the one screen that says: ‘Do these few things today and your pipeline stays tight.’</p>
        <p>We’ll start with three tiles: Missed Call → Text Back, Review Requests, and Weekly Owner Dashboard. When a buyer or seller calls and you miss it, this tile fires and texts them back inside 60 seconds with a link to reply or book. When a deal closes, this tile asks for a Google review automatically. And every Monday morning, this tile emails you one page with money, new leads, showings, and closings.</p>
        <p>I’ll wire your version live in front of you so you can see it working—no black box. If it doesn’t earn its keep in the first month, we don’t add more tiles.”</p>

          <li>Left column: <em>Today’s Script</em> with “Call these 3 people” and “Reply to these 2 missed calls” cards.</li>
          <li>Middle column: <em>Pipeline Episodes</em> tiles for each buyer/seller, showing stage, last touch, and next step.</li>
          <li>Right column: <em>At‑A‑Boy Wall</em> with weekly wins and a small “This week’s numbers” dashboard (leads, showings, offers, closings).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Live demo flow: mark a call as missed → see the Missed Call tile tick up → watch the auto‑text go out → show the episode tile update.</p>

        <h2>Owner-facing script + live demo workflow.</h2>
        <p><strong>Script (spoken):</strong></p>
        <p>“This is your shop wall on a screen. Instead of guessing from texts and paper notes, this Command Center tells you: ‘Hit these jobs and calls today and the whole board moves forward.’</p>
        <p>We start with three tiles: Missed Call → Text Back, Change Order + Invoice Follow‑up, and Weekly Owner Dashboard. When someone calls about a new job and you miss it, the tile auto‑texts them and logs the lead. When a change order is approved but not billed, this tile reminds you and sends the invoice link. Every Monday, this tile emails you one page with jobs in progress, cash trapped in the field, and what’s ready to bill.</p>
        <p>I’ll build your version live so you can see it pull in your jobs and dollars. If you don’t feel more in control after a week, we stop right there.”</p>
        <p><strong>In-dashboard visual:</strong></p>

          <li>Middle column: <em>Jobs Board</em> showing each project as a tile with phase, crew, and next action.</li>
          <li>Right column: <em>At‑A‑Boy Wall</em> with daily wins plus a “Cash in field / Draws ready / Change orders unbilled” mini‑scoreboard.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Live demo flow: mark a job as approved change order → see the tile flag “invoice not sent” → click to send invoice → watch the scoreboard update.</p>
