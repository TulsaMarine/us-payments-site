        <h2>Control center + local AI brain for service operators.</h2>
        <p><strong>Bot‑in‑a‑Box (BnB)</strong> is a preconfigured, verticalized AI + payments control center. Instead of asking a plumber, realtor, or restaurant owner to stitch together SaaS tools and &ldquo;prompt&rdquo; an LLM, we ship them a preloaded box that connects to their systems and presents one Command Center they actually want to open.</p>
        <p>For investors, this is not another chatbot. It&rsquo;s vertical SaaS + local AI automation + payments rails, delivered as something they can literally pick up and plug in.</p>

        <div class="section-label">02 /// Target verticals</div>
        <h2>Beachhead now, expansion later.</h2>
        <p>BnB focuses first on verticals where US Payments has a natural wedge and payments are tightly tied to jobs.</p>
        <div class="grid grid-2">
          <div>
            <h3>Phase 1: Beachhead</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Residential Realtors</strong> &mdash; Realtor Command Center for leads, showings, and deals.</li>
              <li><strong>Home Services</strong> &mdash; Jobs &amp; Trucks Command Center for quotes, jobs, and routes.</li>
              <li><strong>Independent Restaurants</strong> &mdash; Shifts &amp; Covers Command Center for sales, labor, and vendors.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Phase 3: Expansion</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Professional services (accountants, lawyers, consultants).</li>
              <li>Political campaigns (local, state, federal).</li>
              <li>Niche trades (roofers, landscapers, specialty contractors).</li>

        <h2>Too many tools, not enough control.</h2>
        <p>Blue‑collar and service operators live inside a mess of accounting software, CRMs, card readers, text threads, and delivery apps. None of it feels good to open. Owners log in because they have to, not because it helps them run the day.</p>
        <p>AI so far has mostly shown up as generic chatbots or plugins that assume the user is a prompt engineer. It also often means shipping data and intellectual property into someone else&rsquo;s black box.</p>
        <p><strong>BnB starts from a different premise:</strong> give them one motivating control center and an AI brain that can actually move money and work, while keeping their IPR safe.</p>

        <h2>Preloaded box. Guided intake. Self‑configuring system.</h2>
        <p>BnB ships as a preconfigured Mac/PC or appliance, branded and tuned by US Payments.</p>
        <ol class="steps">
          <li>
            <h3>1. Select the vertical</h3>
            <p>Choose Realtor, Restaurant, Home Services, or another supported profile. This loads a vertical manifest of skills and playbooks.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>2. Answer a guided intake</h3>
            <p>Roughly 50 questions about goals, current problems, existing systems, and communication preferences. This becomes the client profile.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>3. Auto‑configuration</h3>
            <p>The box connects to email, calendar, and payments; builds a tailored Dewey Decibel knowledge library; enables the right skills; and spins up a Command Center UI tailored to that business.</p>

        <h2>Brain with muscles, not just another chatbot.</h2>
        <p>Under the hood, every BnB deployment follows a simple pattern:</p>
        <div class="grid grid-2">
          <div>
            <h3>The Brain</h3>
            <p>A local or hybrid LLM agent that understands the business&rsquo;s data, playbooks, and priorities. It can reason about jobs, money, and people instead of just answering free‑form questions.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>The Muscles</h3>
            <p>Connectors and automations into payments, email, calendar, CRMs, the file system, messaging, and scheduled jobs. The agent doesn&rsquo;t just talk &mdash; it takes actions with guardrails.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>This <strong>brain‑with‑muscles</strong> model is the core of US Payments&rsquo; automation strategy.</p>

        <h2>Base feature set for 90% of boxes.</h2>
        <p>Every BnB comes with a Core set of capabilities and skills, regardless of vertical.</p>
        <div class="grid grid-2">
          <div>
            <h3>Core Muscles</h3>
            <ul>

        <h2>Locally hosted agents for IPR‑safe automation.</h2>
        <p>As BnB expands, the platform introduces locally hosted LLM agents that run on the customer&rsquo;s own hardware.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>IPR‑safe by design</strong> &mdash; Sensitive playbooks, pricing logic, and trade secrets stay on the customer&rsquo;s machine instead of a shared SaaS model.</li>
          <li><strong>On‑prem intelligence</strong> &mdash; The agent has full access to their Dewey library, payments data, and systems without streaming proprietary data to third‑party clouds.</li>
          <li><strong>Verticalized agents</strong> &mdash; Each vertical gets a tuned brain with muscles (Realtor, Restaurant, Home Services, etc.), but the IPR and data gravity live at the edge.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This makes BnB legible to investors and operators who care about intellectual property rights, data gravity, and long‑term defensibility.</p>

        <h2>Addiction, not obligation.</h2>
        <p>The Command Center is the main surface area of BnB. It&rsquo;s designed to be emotionally rewarding to open, not a punishment screen like most accounting software.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One clear &ldquo;Today&rdquo; lane with a short, prioritized script.</li>
          <li>Vertical‑native metaphors (episodes for Realtors, jobs and trucks for trades, shifts and covers for restaurants).</li>
          <li>Positive reinforcement: streaks, wins, and an &ldquo;At‑A‑Boy&rdquo; wall that highlights progress.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By becoming the place they start their day, BnB positions itself as the operating shell of the business, not a replaceable utility.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="section-label">09 /// Model &amp; moat</div>
        <h2>How this becomes a durable business.</h2>
        <p>The model combines:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hardware/appliance margin for customers who want a physical box.</li>
          <li>Recurring subscription for updates, monitoring, and new skills.</li>
          <li>Implementation and advisory revenue for higher‑touch customers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Defensibility comes from vertical playbooks and UX, the Dewey Decibel library, deep integrations, local/IPR‑safe agents, and habit formation around the Command Center.</p>
