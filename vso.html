        <h2>Command Centers built for veteran service organizations.</h2>
        <p>VSOs sit at the intersection of mission, community, and logistics. Most of the tools that exist today are either generic donor CRMs or one-off spreadsheets. US Payments and Bot-in-a-Box are being built so veteran organizations can have the same level of control and intelligence as a serious business, without losing the heart of the mission.</p>
        <p>This page will become the home for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prebuilt Command Center templates for VSOs and local posts.</li>
          <li>Mission computers that can run on-site at posts or offices.</li>
          <li>Payment and donation flows tuned for events, drives, and recurring support.</li>
        </ul>

          <div class="card-grid-item">
            <h3>Local posts & chapters</h3>
            <p>Give local leadership a simple Command Center that tracks events, members, and money in one place. No more guessing who paid dues, who is active, or which events actually move the mission.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card-grid-item">
            <h3>Job and opportunity boards</h3>
            <p>Use a Command Center as the front door for jobs, training, and opportunities for vets—tied into the same mission computer that runs day-to-day operations.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card-grid-item">
            <h3>Donations & drives</h3>
            <p>Run campaigns with clear totals, progress, and follow-up actions, instead of scattered spreadsheets and uncertain numbers.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="card-grid-item">
            <h3>Partner programs</h3>
            <p>Connect veteran-owned businesses, employers, and donors through a shared control center so it’s obvious where support is going and what it’s doing.</p>

        <h2>If you run or support a VSO and this speaks to you.</h2>
        <p>This page is a first draft. The right way to build it out is with input from people who actually run and live inside veteran organizations.</p>
        <p><strong>Next step:</strong> If you are part of a VSO and want to explore Command Centers or mission computers for your organization, reach out directly.</p>
